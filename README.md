Welcome to the Summary and Sentiment NLP project! This repository aims to provide natural language processing functionalities to summarize text and analyze sentiments. We believe this project has great potential, and we are excited to invite collaborators to join us in making it even better.** It only works for yelp.com aiim to make it better**.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to develop an NLP application that can summarize lengthy texts and perform sentiment analysis on them. With this tool, users can quickly grasp the essence of long documents and gain insights into the overall sentiment expressed in the text.




## Technologies Used

The project is intented to built using the following technologies:

- Python for backend NLP processing
- React for frontend user interface
- pytorch
- flask and other library

- Write clear and concise commit messages.
- Ensure your code is well-documented and easy to understand.
- Test your changes thoroughly to avoid breaking existing functionality.
- Be open to feedback and respectful during discussions.

## How to Run the Project
To run the project locally, follow these steps:
1. **Install the required Python packages from the requirements.txt file using pip. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's backend folder.**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. ***Once all dependencies are installed, you can run the Flask backend using the following command:**
   ```
   python app.py
   ```


## Current Issues

1. **Website Responsiveness:** The current React/html frontend  not responsive on all devices and screen sizes. We need help from frontend developers to make the website responsive and user-friendly across various devices.

2. **Expand Supported Websites:** Presently, the application only handles Yelp URLs for text analysis. We'd like to expand the supported websites to include Amazon and other popular platforms. Collaborators with experience in web scraping and NLP integration are welcome to tackle this task.

3. **Backend Speed Optimization:** Some users have reported that the backend takes longer than expected to predict sentiment or generate summaries. We need contributors who can identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the backend processes for better response times.


## Code of Conduct

We follow an inclusive and welcoming environment for all contributors. Be respectful and considerate of others' opinions and ideas. Harassment, discrimination, or any form of disrespectful behavior will not be tolerated.
